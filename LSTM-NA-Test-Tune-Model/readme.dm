The suggested LSTM-NA method has several advantages. First, it obtains the properties from the structure of two networks directly and without any assumption. 

Second, LSTM-NA can be trained once due to usage of deep learning, and using transfer learning method, can be applied several times to test the network alignment and matching of nodes existing between networks. 

Third, the LSTM-NA runtime is in order of seconds or minutes and is faster than other network alignment methods.

Fourth, the LSTM-NA model can operate independently of the BLAST score and predict network alignment correctly. 

Last, LSTM-NA is an end-to-end model because it obtains the properties and predicts simultaneously.
