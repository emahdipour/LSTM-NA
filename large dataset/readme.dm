For evaluation of suggested method eﬃciency, we selected ﬁve biological species of Biogrid dataset are generated after data purging and ﬁltration and identity registration. 
Also, we use coding similar to Isobase coding.

In this dataset, we have 15 pairs of protein-protein interaction networks that can be examined in terms of network alignment.
Each data have three columns such as follow: Interactor A, Interactor B, BLAST score.
 
You can set name of species in the program and run for any species pair.
