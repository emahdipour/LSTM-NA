For evaluation of suggested method eﬃciency, we selected ﬁve biological species of Biogrid or Isobase dataset from which networks with speciﬁcations shown in table 1 (of paper) are generated after data purging and ﬁltration and identity registration. 
Also, we use coding similar to Isobase coding.

In this dataset, we have 15 pairs of protein-protein interaction networks that can be examined in terms of network alignment.
Each data have three columns such as follow: Interactor A, Interactor B, BLAST score.
 
You can set name of species in the program and run for any species pair.
